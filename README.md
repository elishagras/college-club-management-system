# college-club-management-system
The aim of the project titled “COLLEGE CLUB MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” is to develop an enterprise software that optimizes the performance of the clubs in our college. The system helps the firm to receive the registration of various clubs from individual students irrespective of their department and year. Along with registration, students can also keep a track of upcoming events and their details. Details of the coordinator will be given in the description. Students can access different facilities provided by the club.
